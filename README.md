# Twin-Strings

Two strings, a and b, are said to be twins only if they can be made equivalent by performing some number of operations on one or both strings. There are two possible operations:

SwapEven: Swap a character at an even-numbered index with a character at another even-numbered index.
SwapOdd: Swap a character at an odd-numbered index with a character at another odd-numbered index.
For example, a = "abcd" and b = "cdab" are twins because we can make them equivalent by performing operations. Alternatively, a = "abcd" and b = "bcda" are not twins (operations do not move characters between odd and even indices), and neither are a = "abc" and b = "ab" (no amount of operations will insert a c into string b).

Complete the code in the editor below, the twins() method with the following params.

An array of n strings named a.
An array of n strings named b.
The function must return an array of strings where each index i (0 ≤ i < n) contains the string Yes if ai and bi are twins or the string No if they are not.

Input Format:
The internal test cases will pass the following input to the program using the STDIN and expect output on the STDOUT:

The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in a.

Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < n) contains a string describing ai.

The next line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in b.

Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < n) contains a string describing bi.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 103
1 ≤ length(ai), length(bi) ≤ 100
ai and bi are not guaranteed to have the same length.
Strings ai and bi contain lowercase letters only (i.e., a through z).

Sample Input:
2
cdab
dcba
2
abcd
abcd

Sample Output:
Yes
No

Explanation:
Given a = ["cdab", "dcba"] and b = ["abcd", "abcd"], we process each element like so:

a0 = "cdab" and b0 = "abcd": We store Yes in index 0 of the return array because a0 = "cdab" → "adcb" → "abcd" = b0.
a1 = "dcba" and b1 = "abcd": We store No in index 1 of the return array because no amount of operations will move a character from an odd index to an even index, so the two strings will never be equal.
